        <p>I will be listing every meal I ate this weekend and my ratings on them</p>
        <p>Some of the <strong>faboulous dishes</strong> are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spur's Stake</li>
            <li>Mixed Rice</li> 
            <li>Chicken strips</li>
            <li>Buttered buns</li>
        </ol>

        <p> My <i>ratings</i> on each dish are as followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Spur's steak was by far the tastiest dish on this list. A complete 10 out of 10</li>
            <li>A mixture of jollof and fried rice. Amazing but nothing special.  7 out of 10 </li>
            <li>Strips of chicken fried in a spicy sauce. Apart from being too spicy, it was delicious. 9/10</li>
            <li>Meant as an appetizer. Just a fancier form of bread and butter. 5 out of 10</li>
        </ul>
